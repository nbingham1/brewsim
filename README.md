# brewsim

Process simulator for brewing and distilling. Executes a brute-force state space exploration for task scheduling given resource requirements and an order list.

## compile

Compiling this requires [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [tup](http://gittup.org/).

```
tup
```

Then the compiled binary can be found in build.
